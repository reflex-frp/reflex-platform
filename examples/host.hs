This program gives an example of how to construct a simple framework that
allows programmers to write FRP applications that process keystrokes (of
type Char) to produce a view (of type String).  This model, where programmers
process Event(s) to produce Behavior(s) is akin to the OpenGL/GLUT model, where
input is pushed into the application via callbacks and an output is pulled
via periodic sampling in a render function.  Other application models work
differently; for example, DOM applications built with reflex-dom ultimately
produce Events rather than Behaviors as their output, since changes need to be
pushed (rather than pulled) into the web browser's DOM hierarchy.  The precise
mix of input and output structures required will depend on the needs of the
external systems with which the FRP-enabled program is interacting.
